        <section class="mb-10">
            <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold primary mb-4">Cancellation Policy</h2>
            <p class="text-lg">
                We understand that circumstances may arise where you need to cancel our services. Below is our comprehensive Cancellation Policy to ensure transparency and clarity.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- General Cancellation Policy Section -->
        <section class="mb-8">
            <h3 class="text-3xl font-semibold primary mb-4">1. General Cancellation Policy</h3>
            <div class="ml-6">
                <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">1. How to Cancel:</h4>
                <p class="text-lg mb-2">Clients may cancel their digital services agreement by providing written notice via email to <a href="mailto:services@pixanostudio.site" class="underline">services@pixanostudio.site</a> or directly through their customer dashboard. All cancellation requests must be acknowledged by our team to be considered valid.</p>

                <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">2. Timing for Cancellations:</h4>
                <p class="text-lg mb-2">Ongoing Digital Services: For ongoing services (such as SEO, social media management, or website maintenance), cancellations must be requested at least 7 days before the next billing cycle. If the cancellation request is submitted after the 7-day window or after services have already commenced for the current billing cycle, you will still be charged for that cycle, and the cancellation will apply from the next cycle onward.</p>

                <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">3. Effect of Late Cancellations:</h4>
                <p class="text-lg mb-2">If you request a cancellation after work has begun (for instance, after an SEO campaign has started), you will not be eligible for a refund for that month’s services. In this case, the cancellation will take effect at the start of the next billing period.</p>

                <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">4. No Refund for Completed Work:</h4>
                <p class="text-lg mb-2">Once the agreed-upon work for the billing cycle has started, it is deemed non-refundable as we dedicate resources and time to fulfilling the service.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <!-- Project-Based Services Section -->
        <section class="mb-8">
            <h3 class="text-3xl font-semibold primary mb-4">2. Project-Based Services (One-Time Services)</h3>
            <div class="ml-6">
                <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">1. Eligible Cancellations:</h4>
                <p class="text-lg mb-2">For one-time project-based services such as web development, graphic design, content creation, or other tailored projects, cancellations must be made within 48 hours of confirming the project in order to receive a full refund of any advance payments made.</p>

                <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">2. Cancellations After Work Has Started:</h4>
                <p class="text-lg mb-2">If a cancellation request is submitted after the initial 48-hour window, a refund will be issued based on the percentage of the work completed by the time of cancellation.</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-6 mb-2">
                    <li>If less than 25% of the project has been completed, the client will be eligible for a 50% refund of the total project fee.</li>
                    <li>If 25-50% of the project has been completed, the client will be eligible for a 25% refund of the total project fee.</li>
                    <li>If more than 50% of the project has been completed, no refund will be issued.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">3. How Project Progress is Assessed:</h4>
                <p class="text-lg mb-2">The progress of the project is evaluated based on deliverables such as drafts, designs, development phases, or milestones achieved up to the date of the cancellation request.</p>

            <div class="ml-6">
                <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">1. Campaign Cancellations:</h4>
                <p class="text-lg mb-2">Cancellations for Paid Advertising Campaigns (e.g., Google Ads, Facebook Ads, Social Media, or PPC campaigns) must be made at least 5 business days before the campaign's scheduled start date. This allows us sufficient time to halt campaign setup and prevent unnecessary ad spend.</p>

                <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">2. Impact of Late Cancellations:</h4>
                <p class="text-lg mb-2">Once a digital marketing campaign has started, no cancellations or refunds will be issued for the ad spend or management fees. This is because ad budgets are allocated and managed in real-time, and our team incurs costs for campaign setup, research, and execution.</p>

                <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">3. Unused Ad Spend:</h4>
                <p class="text-lg mb-2">In the event of a campaign being canceled before its start date, any unused ad spend may be refunded. However, any setup fees related to the campaign will remain non-refundable.</p>

                <p class="text-lg mb-2">Fees for consultation services are non-refundable once the consultation has been completed.</p>

                <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">2. Custom Deliverables:</h4>
                <p class="text-lg mb-2">Any custom digital assets (e.g., graphics, content, website mockups) that have been completed and delivered to the client are considered non-refundable.</p>

                <p class="text-lg mb-2">In cases where unforeseen circumstances (such as natural disasters, global pandemics, or other events beyond our control) prevent us from delivering the agreed-upon services, we may offer flexibility in cancellation terms or partial refunds, depending on the situation.</p>

                <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">2. Client Involvement:</h4>
                <p class="text-lg mb-2">If the client fails to provide necessary information or approval in a timely manner, leading to project delays, PixanoStudio reserves the right to proceed with the project or reschedule based on our availability. This may affect the client’s eligibility for refunds if delays occur from the client’s end.</p>
